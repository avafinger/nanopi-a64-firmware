NanoPi A64 Ubuntu Xenial Xerus 16.04 LXDE OS Image (firmware)
=============================================================

LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is a desktop environment which is lightweight 
and fast and uses less RAM and less CPU while being a feature rich desktop environment.

If you want a richer desktop environment (but slower) you can install 
Ubuntu MATE on top of this Image and later de-install LXDE.

I use LXDE just because it is very fast, snappy  and responsive!
You can always improve, tweak and tune the way you want at any time.
This is a very LEAN and MEAN OS image to play and learn how to extend it.

This is a blind LXDE OS image for the NanoPi A64 not tested
